# ctx — Scope Document

**Status:** Draft v0.1  
**Author:** Leo Karthik Paramasivan  
**Date:** 2026-06-26

---

## Tool 1 + Tool 2 — `ctx-capture` + `ctx`

Delivered together. Single release. Shared store contract.

---

### ctx-capture

**What it is**

Developer-side SDK. Instruments a RAG or agentic pipeline at key stages. Writes structured run records to a local SQLite store. Invisible on failure.

**What it is not**

Not an analysis tool. Not a CLI. Not opinionated about the pipeline stack.

---

**Delivery scope**

**Core capture API**

```python
ctx.start(query, pipeline)      # begins a run, creates session if needed
run.chunks(chunks)              # retrieval stage
run.context(prompt, budget)     # assembly stage
run.history(pre, post, reason)  # history management stage
run.response(response, usage)   # LLM output stage
run.cache(events)               # cache events
run.commit()                    # writes to store
```

Thread-local active run — `ctx.*` accessible across files without passing run object.

Auto-commit on `run.response()` if `run.commit()` not called explicitly.

**Single-line fallback**

```python
ctx.capture(query, response)    # minimum viable — two fields only
```

**Scaffold generator**

```bash
ctx-capture init
```

Generates a starter `ctx_pipeline.py` with capture calls pre-positioned at correct pipeline stages. For Dev 1 — greenfield only.

**Session management**

Auto-session grouping on 30-minute idle gap. New session created automatically. No developer action required.

**Store initialisation**

`~/.ctx/runs.db` created on first capture. Schema migrations handled internally. `meta` table holds schema version.

**Failure contract**

All capture calls wrapped in try/except internally. Failures logged to `~/.ctx/errors.log`. Pipeline never interrupted under any circumstance.

---

**Schema — owned by ctx-capture**

```sql
meta(key, value)
sessions(session_id, title, pipeline, created_at)
runs(session_id, run_seq, query, pipeline, created_at, run_data JSON)
```

Indexes on `created_at`, `query`, `pipeline`.

---

**Data types**

```
RunRecord       — top-level run container
ChunkRecord     — per-chunk retrieval data
TokenBudget     — assembly budget breakdown
TokenUsage      — LLM token consumption
Turn            — single history turn
CacheEvent      — per-chunk cache hit/miss
```

All fields except `query` and `response` optional. `**kwargs` on capture methods — future fields never break existing instrumentation.

---

**Out of scope**

- No analysis
- No rendering
- No search
- No evaluation
- No improvement
- No network calls
- No cloud sync

---

**Dependencies**

```
stdlib only — sqlite3, dataclasses, typing, threading
```

Zero third-party dependencies.

---

**Deliverables**

```

- `ctx-capture init` generates a runnable scaffold
- Capture with two fields works without error
- Capture with all fields works without error
- Pipeline never raises on capture failure
- `~/.ctx/runs.db` created on first run
- Schema version present in `meta` table
- Sessions auto-created on 30-minute idle gap
- Thread-local run accessible across module boundaries

---
---

### ctx

**What it is**

Standalone analyst CLI. Reads from `~/.ctx/runs.db`. Browse sessions, search runs, explain a specific run. Read-only consumer of the store.

**What it is not**

Not a capture tool. Not an evaluation tool. Never writes to the store.

---

**Delivery scope**

**Command surface**

```bash
ctx list                          # list sessions, most recent first
ctx list s2                       # list runs inside session 2
ctx find <hint>                   # search runs by query text
ctx find <hint> --exact           # phrase match instead of token match
ctx find <hint> --from <date>     # date filter
ctx find <hint> --to <date>       # date filter
ctx find <hint> --today           # shorthand date filter
ctx find <hint> --session <id>    # scope to session
ctx find <hint> --pipeline <name> # scope to pipeline
ctx find --recent                 # latest N runs, no hint
ctx explain                       # latest run
ctx explain <target>              # specific run — s2r3
ctx explain <target> --full       # expanded output
ctx explain <target> --html       # snapshot to ~/.ctx/reports/
ctx diff <target> <target>        # compare two runs
ctx budget <target>               # token waterfall only
ctx session rename <id> <title>   # rename a session
```

---

**Target addressing**

Resolution order — same for all commands:

```
1. Exact ID (s2r3)          →  direct lookup
2. No arg                   →  latest run in latest session
3. Quoted hint              →  search → single match → proceed
                               multiple matches → disambiguation screen
                               no match → suggest closest
```

---

**Search — ctx find**

Token match default — hint split into terms, OR logic across query text:

```sql
WHERE query LIKE '%score%' OR query LIKE '%fusion%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
```

All filters are pre-query SQL. LLM not involved anywhere in the navigation path.

Semantic search — optional, enabled when Ollama or sentence-transformers configured. BM25 weighted 0.7, semantic 0.3, fused via RRF. Falls back to BM25-only gracefully when no model available.

Disambiguation screen when multiple matches:

```
  s2 r3   2026-06-08   RRF investigation   — "does RRF handle score scale differences"
  s2 r2   2026-06-08   RRF investigation   — "why does BM25 score differ from ANN score"

  Pick (s2r3 / s2r2) or refine:
```

---

**Analysis — ctx explain**

Seven factors. Each computed deterministically at read time from captured run data. Skipped silently if required data not present.

```
Token usage       — per-section breakdown, headroom, model limit
Duplicate chunks  — path dups, window dups, semantic dups (if embedding available)
Chunk scores      — retrieval score + rerank score distribution
Truncation        — which chunks trimmed, at what boundary, score of truncated chunks
Dropped history   — pre/post eviction diff, eviction reason
Cache hits        — hit/miss ratio, which chunks came from cache
Final prompt      — assembled prompt as-is
```

Duplicate detection tiers:

```
[PATH DUP]     same chunk_id, retrieved via both BM25 and ANN
[WINDOW DUP]   same source_doc_id, overlapping token window
[SEMANTIC DUP] cosine sim above threshold (requires embedding model)
```

Output modes:

```
default    —  compact, one screen
--full     —  all sections, all chunks
--html     —  snapshot to ~/.ctx/reports/<run_id>.html
```

---

**Diff — ctx diff**

Two confirmed targets. Deterministic comparison:

```
query delta
chunks added / removed
score delta per chunk
token budget delta
history delta
truncation delta
```

Primary use: comparing two iterations of the same query within a session.

---

**ctx list output**

```
Sessions view:
  ID    RUNS   PIPELINE   CREATED      TITLE
  s5    3      rkis       2h ago       auto: "does RRF handle score..."
  s4    2      rkis       1d ago       Cross-encoder reranking

Runs view (ctx list s2):
  s2 r4   2026-06-19   "does rerank order depend on retrieval scores"
  s2 r3   2026-06-19   "does RRF handle score scale differences"
```

---

**Out of scope**

- No write operations to the store
- No evaluation scoring
- No improvement passes
- No LLM calls in navigation path
- No cloud sync
- No multi-user support

## Tool 3 — `ctx-evaluate`

**Delivered separately, after ctx-capture + ctx are stable.**

---

### What it is

Evaluation layer. Takes a captured run. Scores it across two dimensions — input quality (mechanical, deterministic) and output quality (RAGAS or equivalent, LLM-as-judge). Writes scores back to the run record. Accumulates benchmark data over time.

**What it is not**

Not a capture tool. Not a browsing tool. Not an improvement tool.

---

**Delivery scope**

**Two evaluation layers**

Layer 1 — Input quality. Deterministic. No LLM required.

```
Relevance score     — SLM cosine similarity per chunk vs query
Duplicate ratio     — path + window + semantic duplicates as percentage
Truncation severity — were high-score chunks truncated?
Token efficiency    — headroom, low-score chunk ratio
Coherence signal    — source domain count, score variance
```

Layer 2 — Output quality. LLM-as-judge via RAGAS.

```
faithfulness
answer_relevancy
context_precision
context_recall
```

Both layers write to a new `eval_scores` field on the run record.

---

**Benchmark system**

Builds correlation model between input quality factors and output quality scores across accumulated runs.

```bash
ctx-evaluate benchmark build          # correlate input factors vs output scores
ctx-evaluate benchmark show           # display discovered thresholds
ctx-evaluate benchmark check s2r3     # score a run against benchmark
ctx-evaluate benchmark export         # export as RAGAS-compatible dataset
```

Bootstrap path — no historical runs yet:

```bash
ctx-evaluate benchmark seed           # generate synthetic known-good
                                      # and known-bad context windows
                                      # as day-zero baseline
```

Synthetic baseline is replaced progressively by real run data.

---

**Policy system**

Human-defined rules encoding known failure modes. Active from day one, before benchmark has data.

```python
@dataclass
class InputQualityPolicy:
    min_chunk_relevance_score:    float = 0.5
    min_top_chunk_score:          float = 0.7
    max_duplicate_ratio:          float = 0.2
    max_low_score_chunk_ratio:    float = 0.3
    min_token_headroom:           float = 0.15
    max_high_score_truncations:   int   = 0
    max_source_domains:           int   = 3
    llm_rewrite_risk_threshold:   float = 0.7
```

Defaults encode known failure modes from the literature. Developer overrides per pipeline.

---

**Risk score**

Single 0.0–1.0 score computed from input state against active policy. Gates Stage 3 improvement (future tool). Stored on the run record.

```python
def compute_risk_score(run, policy) -> float:
    # weighted sum of policy violations
    # truncation and top chunk score weighted highest
```

---

**Schema additions — ctx-evaluate owns**

```sql
ALTER TABLE runs ADD COLUMN eval_scores JSON;
ALTER TABLE runs ADD COLUMN risk_score REAL;
ALTER TABLE runs ADD COLUMN evaluated_at TEXT;

CREATE TABLE benchmark (
    pipeline        TEXT,
    factor          TEXT,
    threshold       REAL,
    correlation     REAL,
    sample_count    INTEGER,
    updated_at      TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (pipeline, factor)
);

CREATE TABLE policies (
    pipeline        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    policy_data     JSON,
    updated_at      TEXT
);
```

---

**CLI surface**

```bash
ctx-evaluate run s2r3                 # evaluate one run — both layers
ctx-evaluate run s2r3 --input-only    # skip RAGAS, input quality only
ctx-evaluate run s2r3 --output-only   # skip input, RAGAS only
ctx-evaluate run --session s2         # evaluate all runs in session
ctx-evaluate benchmark build
ctx-evaluate benchmark show
ctx-evaluate benchmark check s2r3
ctx-evaluate benchmark seed
ctx-evaluate benchmark export
ctx-evaluate policy show              # show active policy
ctx-evaluate policy set <field> <val> # update a policy value
ctx-evaluate policy reset             # restore defaults
```

---

**Out of scope**

- No capture
- No browsing
- No improvement passes
- No cloud evaluation services beyond RAGAS API calls
- ctx-improve integration deferred — risk score computed and stored, consumed later

- `ctx-evaluate benchmark show` displays per-factor thresholds
- `ctx-evaluate benchmark export` produces RAGAS-compatible dataset
- Risk score between 0.0 and 1.0 stored on run record
- Policy defaults apply without any developer configuration
- Policy overrides persist across sessions
- Schema migration runs cleanly on existing runs.db

## Build order

```
Phase 1   ctx-capture + ctx          single release, delivered together
Phase 2   ctx-evaluate               after Phase 1 is stable
Phase 3   ctx-improve                lowest priority, future
```

## Future — ctx-improve

Deferred. Acts on risk score and benchmark findings to improve context quality before the LLM call. Three stages — filter (rules + SLM), rerank (SLM), rewrite (LLM, opt-in). Consumes output of ctx-evaluate. No scope defined until ctx-evaluate is stable and benchmark has real data.
